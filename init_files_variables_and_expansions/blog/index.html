    <h1>What does ls *.c do in the ubuntu terminal?</h1>
    <p>This question arrised in my second week in Holberton coding school. In this school, the way they teach you is by learning through practice. Or as I like to say trial by fire. The reason I call it like this is because in Holberton the learning process is by giving you tasks to perform with deadlines. At first these deadlines are easy because they give you a lot of time to finnish them which is excelent! But then the real fun begins. They give you big projects to finnish in a relatively short amount of time. Not an impossible deadline but enough to make you sweat! on Febuary 15 I had to complete a task that asked me the question that was on the title of this blog and to be honest, at least in my shell; nothing happenned! I was really disappointed and thought maybe I wrote the syntax wrong or did not write it in the correct directory so I tried multiple directories and still nothing happenned. So I quickly started to follow a framework they gave us on the first day that tells us how to resolve problems we might encounter on our proggraming journey and I couldn't figure out why it did not do anything on my shell. That is why I googled the answer and I will explain as best as I can to help you understand what happens when you write "ls *.c" in shell.</p>
    <h2>Understanding the syntax</h2>
    <p>The syntax is composed of the command ls which means list. This will give you a list of all the content of a file or directory. Also it contains the wildcard * which means you the user want the shell to look for any file containing the characters you specified like in this case files that contain ".c". The .c stands for files that are written in c language which is a language used in proggraming to help the computer process and display the information which is contained in the file. In other words you want shell to look for all files written in c language and list them.</p>
